              Food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate,
              fat, and other nutrients used in the body of an organism to
              sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish energy. The
              absorption and utilization of food by the body is fundamental to
              nutrition and is facilitated by digestion. Plants, which convert
              solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food
              source. Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food
              for other animals. To learn more about the sequence of transfers
              of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to
              organism, see food chain.
